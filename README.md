## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Ensures clean separation of concerns.
  - **Model**: Manages the state of the game, including the active puzzle and its properties.
  - **View**: Renders the user interface, including the puzzle grid and controls.
  - **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

### Key Classes

- `AppLauncher`: The entry point of the application, manages scenes and stage.
- `ControllerImpl`: Implements the game logic and updates the model based on user input.
- `ModelImpl`: Represents the game state and validates puzzle conditions.
- `PuzzleView`, `ControlView`, `MessageView`: Render the puzzle grid, control buttons, and dynamic messages.
- `SamplePuzzles`: Contains preloaded puzzles for the game.
- `Main`: Contains the main method to launch the application.

### Key Interfaces

- `AlternateMvcController`: Defines the methods for handling user input and updating the game state.
- `ClassicMvcController`: Extends `AlternateMvcController` and adds methods for managing the game state.
- `Model`: Defines the methods for managing the game state and validating puzzle conditions.
- `Puzzle`: Represents a single puzzle with a grid, clues, and solution.
- `PuzzleLibrary`: Contains a collection of puzzles and methods for accessing them.
- `FXComponent`: Represents a JavaFX component with methods for initializing and updating the view.

### Dependencies

- **Java 17+**: Core programming language for the application.
- **JavaFX**: Used for the user interface and event handling.
- **JUnit 4**: For unit testing the model and controller logic.
- **Mockito**: For mocking dependencies during testing.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or later.
- Maven for dependency management (optional).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hoangsonww/Akari-Puzzle-Game-JavaFX.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Akari-Puzzle-Game-JavaFX
   ```
3. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```
   Alternatively, you can run the `AppLauncher` class directly from your IDE, if you are using IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and have JavaFX configured.

## Development

### Adding New Puzzles

1. Open the `SamplePuzzles` class.
2. Add a new 2D integer array representing the puzzle grid.
3. Register the new puzzle in the `PuzzleLibrary` within `AppLauncher`.

### Styling

- Modify the `main.css` file to customize the appearance of the application.
- Use of CSS styles to change colors, fonts, and layout properties.

### Unit Testing
- Run the JUnit 4 test suite to validate the functionality:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```
- Test cases cover model logic, controller actions, and game state validation.
- Alternative: Run individual test classes directly from your IDE.
